<h3>
    The Shawshank Redemption
</h3>

<p>
    It teaches us the meaning of finding and defining our own purpose and 
    self-accept ourselves.

<h3>
    Gladiator
</h3>

<p>
    It's an unorthodox love story, a tale of survival against insurmountable 
    odds, an action film, an exploration of the political situation in Rome, 
    and a historical epic.

<h3>
    Enemy at the Gates
</h3>

<p>
    Tense and violent WWII movie. While it does have some solid moments of 
    action, the film as a whole is laughable. There's a decent movie buried 
    in here somewhere, but the lousy love triangle and ultimate lack of focus 
    make this WWII drama a bit hard to take.
